# Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) Observatory Optimization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on identifying the optimal observatory and observation times for monitoring a gamma-ray burst (GRB) event. The goal was to determine the best observatory location and timing based on atmospheric conditions, lunar phases, and the GRB’s transit across the meridian. The project involves using various observatory sites, astronomical calculations, and analysis techniques to maximize observation quality.

## Methodology

* Meridian Transit Calculations: Calculated the days when the GRB would transit the local meridian at midnight, ensuring it was observed when it was highest in the sky.
* Moon Interference: Evaluated the GRB's angular distance from the Moon and lunar phases to minimize light pollution and maximize observation quality.
* Atmospheric Conditions: Prioritized observatories with high elevation to reduce atmospheric distortion.
  
## Results

GROWTH-India Telescope: Best observatory due to optimal conditions with minimal atmospheric interference.
Favorable observation windows identified:
Palomar, S.D.S.U., Table Mountain, Wise Observatories: 2025-08-16 to 2025-08-18, with angular distances from the Moon ranging from 108.81° to 135.64° during the Last Quarter Moon phase.
Stella Robotic Observatory: Best date on 2024-09-05 during the New Moon phase with a Moon angular distance of 121.98°.
Fenton Hill Observatory: Favorable conditions from 2025-08-21 to 2025-08-23 during the New Moon phase.

## Tools and Technologies

Python: Used for astronomical calculations and data analysis.
Astronomical Databases: Accessed observatory information and celestial data using the Simbad database.
Coordinate Transformations: Employed methods to transform celestial coordinates into the AltAz system for accurate observation planning.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of observational astronomy techniques to optimize GRB monitoring by considering environmental factors and celestial mechanics. The findings and methodologies can serve as a reference for planning future astronomical observations.
